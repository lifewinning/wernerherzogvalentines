# Werner Herzog Valentines

This began as a running joke with my friend Kate Morgan when I was in college. Then it was a silly hashtag that basically only five people ever participated in. Then I got really sick and was told "don't do any real work" and you know, joke websites are definitely not that. So.

Inspired by/blatantly borrowing library usage from the excellent [realavocadofact.com](http://realavocadofact.com).

We welcome pull requests for more Herzog sweet nothings. Please don't sue me Werner Herzog.

"Thanking You"
